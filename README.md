# Genetic Forest

Genetic algorithm (carry forward best variants, mask poor-performers)

# Best Run Charateristics

- 2/3 samples per iteration (0.666)
- 1/100 variants (0.01)
- 10000 trees per forest
- 10 iterations
- 0 importance cutoff

# TODO: 
make importance cutoff z score since the scale is arbitrary (though should center on 0)
